Hey!
Thanks for stopping by. I know it looks a little "bare bones" right now, a little "Default Template" as it were, but I plan on beautifying things as time goes on. 

**Let me briefly introduce myself**
My name is Ben Looper, and my entire life I've wanted to be a scientist. My aptitude for language led me to attend and graduate from Texas A&M with a BA in International Studies, where I learned Mandarin Chinese(我说中文。。。差不多). About a year after I graduated, I was at a friend's birthday party when I happened to meet a very interesting person. He was a DevOps Engineer for HP, and the entire evening I couldn't stop asking him about his job. Until that point, I had no real understanding of what software engineering even **was**. With the help of my new friend, many Udemy courses, (a very understanding girlfriend), and many hours spent in front of my laptop, I've slowly developed that understanding. I have discovered a field where anyone with a computer and a curious mind is able to investigate the world with incredibly powerful tools; where the limit of what I can do is set only by my imagination and willigness to continuously learn.

Setting my rampant idealism to the side for now, let me tell you what I plan on doing:
- Hardcore Data Science 
- Develop cool tools that will make people's lives easier (emphasis on my own life)
- Arduino (To collect my own data and develop my own real-life tools)
- Web Development 
- Security
- Quality Assurance (I like to break things, which may or may not be suprising to you by now)

This is just a general list of topics I'd like to dive into. I've only been doing this for a year now, so it is certainly subject to change. Well my friends, that's it for now, thanks for stopping by. Hopefully next time I'll have some cool projects put up here, and hopefully they work!
