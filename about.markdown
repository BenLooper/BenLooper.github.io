 My name is Ben, and thanks to a random encounter with a now good friend about a year ago, I discovered programming and software engineering (at a party no less, what a fun backstory this is). At that point, I had no experience programming at all and I thought that Linux was a man. But a spark was ignited that night and has since failed to flounder (nice aliteration Ben). I started learning Python on a Raspberry Pi 3 that I set up with Linux - which I'd discovered was not a person - and learned both the OS and the programming language simultaneously. Since then, I've really come to love Python for it's versatility, I feel like I can use it for anything and everything. I've also gained familiarity with Ruby and JavaScript, and of course HTML and CSS as well. I now use GitHub more than I use Instagram or Facebook, so you could say that this has really become an important part of my life. 

I'll be regularly posting thoughts and projects on this site. If you'd like me to try to make something for/with you, offer me an awesome job, or just want to chat, please reach out to me via email at benlooper08@gmail.com .
